# Webscrapper

https://github.com/RianRG/webscrapper/assets/134891464/89222eba-c3d0-47f9-8fe3-05ca45b416a9

A minimalist webscrapper built to list headphones and their details (using my website as target)

## Main concept
It is just a training project, create a webscrapper using NodeJS and Typescript (Im tired of building CRUD projects)

Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites using automated software. It involves sending a request to a website, receiving the HTML response, and then parsing the HTML to extract the desired data.

Basically, this project uses the library "Puppeteer" (node library for web scraping), makes request to my schoolar project website and lists all respective products through a console.log.

(maybe update this project in the future with + actions, like work with lazyloading, type on a search box, etc)
